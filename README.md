This repository is the full code for the Salesforce Connections '23 presentation `Enhance SFMC CloudPages with JavaScript Using VueJS` by Tony Zupancic.

Code in the repository illustrates how you can set up a SFMC CloudPages project using Content Builder Content Blocks and VueJS. The code is organized in a way to mirror the use of Single File Components, that can be reused across your projects and allows code to be isolated and easier to manage.
